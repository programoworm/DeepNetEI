    <h3>This is a basic deep learning based medical application.</h3>
    <p>The prediction about the disease is made with the help of the deep learning model which itself is trained on the thousands of the datasets</p>
    <p>So with the following paragraph I gonna be describing about the types of the diseases which gonna be getting employed in this application.</p>
<h2>1. Diabetes</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 600px" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='diabetes.jpg') }}"/>
   </div>
<p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.</p>
<h3>What health problems can people with diabetes develop? </h3>
<p>Over time, high blood glucose leads to problems such as</p>

 <ul>
  <li>heart disease</li>
  <li>stroke</li>
  <li>kidney disease</li>
  <li>eye problems</li>
  <li>dental disease</li>
  <li>nerve damage</li>
  <li>foot problems</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>2.Heart Disease</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 600px" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='heart.jpg') }}"/>
   </div>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.<br>
  The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.<br>
Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.</p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)</li>
  <li>Shortness of breath</li>
  <li>Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed</li>
  <li>Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>3. Covid 19</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 600px" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='corona.jpg') }}"/>
   </div>
<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>
<h3>Symptoms </h3>
<p>Covid 19 may lead to problems such as</p>

 <ul>
  <li>fever</li>
  <li>dry cough</li>
  <li>tiredness</li>
  <li>eye problems</li>
  <li>loss of taste or smell</li>
  <li>aches and pains</li>
  <li>a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes</li>
</ul>
