# **DeepNet Model with Edge Intelligence**

The whole project can be classified in the following two parts:  

## **Deep Learning part**  
1. intro.py: This Neural Network is built from scratch.
2. main.py: This Neural Network is built using Tensorflow.

## **Simulation of the Edge**  
~Yet to be decided~

### Dependencies  
1. python3  
2. tensorflow  
3. numpy  
4. matplotlib
